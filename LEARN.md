# Solana development 101: Building a calculator using Solana programs

Welcome to the Solana crypto-currency quest. With this quest you'll get upto speed with the most rapidly rising blockchain in the market: *Solana*. It would be awesome if you know a bit 
of Rust (or even C++ concepts) already and are familiar with how blockchains work, but even if you do not have any specific background of Rust or Solana development, we will have all bases covered. If 
you have a high level of interest and motivation, we should be good to go ahead.

In this quest, we will be developing a simple calculator on the Solana blockchain. This essentially means that once you are done with this quest, you will be well versed with the basics of development on 
the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework and would be much better equipped to take on the other Solana quests.

# Setting up the Environment: 

There are a few things that we need to get up and running before we move forward in this quest. Before we move forward make sure you've a working NodeJS environment set up. We need rust, Solana, Mocha(a JS testing framework), Anchor and Phantom wallet for this quest.
To install rust, run
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup component add rustfmt
```

To install Solana, run
```
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.0/install)"
```

To install mocha globally, run
```
npm install -g mocha
```

Now we'll be installing Anchor.
If you're on a linux system, run
```
# Only on linux systems
npm i -g @project-serum/anchor-cli
```

**Fair Warning** : If you are using a Windows system, we highly suggest using [WSL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) (Windows sub-system for Linux) or switching to a Linux environment. Setting up WSL is also quick and easy. A 
good walk-through can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3bPWl9Z2D0&ab_channel=BeachcastsProgrammingVideos)
For any other OS, you need to build from source. Run the following command
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.17.0 anchor-cli --locked
```

To verify that Anchor is installed, run
```
anchor --version
```

Since Solana is still a pretty new blockchain compared to the establised ones out there, it's developer tooling too is pretty limited and cumbersome as of now. However, it is rapidly improving 
and it does so on a daily basis. At the forefront of this development is Anchor, by [Armani Ferrante](https://twitter.com/armaniferrante). You can think of it like the Ruby on Rails framework for
Ruby, that means yes, you can develop things on vanilla Ruby, but Ruby on Rails makes your life much much easier, right? That's the same with Anchor and Solana development. Anchor is the Hardhat of 
Solana development plus much more. It offers a Rust DSL (basically, an easier Rust) to work with along with IDL, CLI and workspace management. Anchor abstracts away a lot of potential security holes
from a conventional Solana
